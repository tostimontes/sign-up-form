# sign-up-form
This is the first version of the sign-up form project from The Odin Project JavaScript curriculum.

- Played a little bit with some minor transitions (input boxes' borders mainly)
- Added some JavaScript listeners for validity checks, as well as password confirmation match
- Media query for smalls screens added too
